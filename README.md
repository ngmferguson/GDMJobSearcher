Searches for job pages off of GameDevMap


So the best way I found for being complete in my job search is going to www.gamedevmap.com and clicking a city/state/province and clicking each studio in there and seeing if they have a job page, etc. This takes a long time, so I made it fast.

I wrote a script which takes a location name as input and will read, sort, and open all webpages with job pages (just if they have "jobs", "careers", "join us", or "opportunities" in the HTML, not 100% hit rate but pretty good). It'll open by N at a time (you input what N is) so you're not opening 50+ tabs at once.

Just download the .zip, unzip it, and click the .exe to run it. It'll ask for a place name as input (it MUST be an option on gamedevmap.com, otherwise you get 0 results.) as well as a number for how many tabs you want opened at a time.

Like I said, I can't promise 100% success getting all website with job pages, there's been a few that I've noticed missing, but this will save A LOT of time.
